I love various dishes and I'm not half bad in the kitchen if I do say so myself. Thought it could be a fun way to brush up my culinary and mingle with other food enthusiasts.

I also spent many days holed up, not in a library, but lost in the numerous art collections across the city, digging for that intriguing piece of mystery or history. The day I finished my thesis was one of relief, exhaustion, and pure joy all at the same time.\n\nGood times, good times! Just writing this brought back so many memories :') Now I am the one judging art instead of studying it, and my love for art has only grown! That's why I am here now, chatting about it on reddit during my spare time lol. \n\nWould I go back? Maybe, for a visit. But I'm much happier sipping my espresso in a little caf√©, answering your questions on my phone, and working on my next big project :D"}

So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. \n\nAnd although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in my city.

Imagine lecturing to a bunch of black screens with muted mics - feels like talking to a wall sometimes.\n\nI'm pretty active on online forums, but trust me, handling video call platforms, online quizzes and grading systems, classroom platforms, it was like learning a whole new tech-language! Had a couple of... let's call them 'embarrassing mishaps' early on, like that time when i accidentally ended the video call while trying to share my screen during a lecture. the students got a good laugh out of that, lol.\n\nAnd don't get me started on setting up home-office. Suddenly, I had to figure out ideal lighting for my video calls, positioning of my laptop, even the color of my wall became apparently incredibly important!\n\nBut you know what, despite the bumpy ride, I do appreciate the quick adaptability it's forced on me. it's also wonderful to be able to share and access academic resources more freely online. Plus, I think students are getting a kick out of screenshotting my confused face when a new tech glitch comes up... Which is.. like... every week. ü§£ so yeah, tech has definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone a good bit!"}
