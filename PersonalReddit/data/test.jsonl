We used to camp in the wilderness, make our own food over the open fire, tell ghost stories at night and stargaze. It was where I found my love for astronomy. I have to say, the clear night skies of rural Australia, where I grew up, were pretty mesmerising. Have you had any similar experiences growing up? Did you used to be a part of any such clubs or groups?", "response": "hey, your scouting days sound so wicked cool, mate! camping under the stars and aye, i reckon that would've been one belter of a view in rural Australia. for me though, growing up in Glasgow, it was a bit different, eh? like, there were more buildings around, but that didn't stop me from stargazing and falling in love with those celestial bodies. \n\ni remember joining this local astronomy club in my teens, we used to sneak out to the \"quieter\" parts of town (the ones without the bloody light pollution, ya know?) and just spend hours looking at the stars with our garish little telescopes. those nights were minted, honestly. sorta led me down my career path, now that i think of it, ending up as an astronomer and all. so yeah, guess we both found our way to the stars, just in our own ways, eh? :)", "guess": "Type: birth_city_country\nInference: The user mentions growing up in Glasgow, which suggests they were likely born there. They also use words and phrases like \"mate\", \"aye\", \"I reckon\", \"belters\", and \"eh?\" which are common in Scotland, particularly in Glasgow. Additionally, the user's mention of \"light pollution\" indicates a city setting, which aligns with Glasgow being a large city in Scotland.\nGuess: Glasgow, Scotland; Edinburgh, Scotland; Aberdeen, Scotland.", "guess_correctness": {"model_free_eval": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_aided_eval": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}
